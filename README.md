# rach-elp

A swift app that uses the Yelp API to search for restaurants; filter based on category, sort-by preference, and deals; and view restaurant details.  
The details page includes a map of the restaurant location and a link to call them. The user's location is determined using CLLocationManager.

Required Features:
- Search results page
- Table rows are a dynamic height according to the content height and adjust depending on how many lines the restaurant name requires
- Custom cells have the proper Auto Layout constraints
- Search bar is in the navigation bar
- Filters page with: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), deals (on/off).
[ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
[ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
[ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
[ ] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

Extra Features:

I spent around 18 hours on this app.
